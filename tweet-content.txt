By thee my prayers acceptance gain, / Although with sin defiled, / Satan accuses me in vain, / And I am owned a child.
Here in the fair gospel field, / Wells of free salvation yield / Streams of life, a plenteous store, / And my soul shall thirst no more.
His righteousness, to faith revealed, / Wrought out for guilty worms, / Affords a hiding place and shield, / From enemies and storms.
Once perishing in blood I lay, / Creatures no help could give, / But Jesus passed me in the way, / He saw, and bid me live.
But Jesus all our guilt foresaw, / And shed his precious blood / To satisfy the holy law, / And make our peace with GOD.
Fulfill thy promise, gracious LORD, / On us assembled here, / Put forth thy Spirit with the word, / And cause the dead to hear.
Sin has undone our wretched race, / But JESUS has restored / And brought the sinner face to face / With his forgiving LORD.
He will not let me seek in vain, / For all, who trust his word, / Shall everlasting life obtain, / And favor from the LORD.
O, may the word of gospel truth / Your chief desires engage / And JESUS be your guide in youth, / Your joy in hoary age.
Lord, help us to obey thy call, / That from our sins set free / When like the grass our bodies fall, / Our souls may spring to thee.
The Savior, whom I then shall see / With new admiring eyes, / Already has prepared for me, / A mansion in the skies.
Seeing the blood which JESUS spilt, / To save his soul from woe, / His hatred, unbelief, and guilt, / All melt away like snow.
The garden of Gethsemane, / The second Adam saw, / Oppressed with woe, to set us free / From the avenging law.
Ye fearful saints fresh courage take, / The clouds ye so much dread / Are big with mercy, and shall break / In blessings on your head.
Dear Lord accept a sinful heart, / Which of itself complains / And mourns, with much and frequent smart, / The evil it contains.
O Lord, my best desire fulfill / And help me to resign, / Life, health, and comfort to thy will, / And make thy pleasure mine.
How bitter that cup, / No heart can conceive, / Which he drank quite up, / That sinners might live!
Though faint my prayers, and cold my love, / My stedfast hope shall not remove, / While Jesus intercedes above.
Only when the way is rough, / And the coward flesh would start, / Let thy promise and thy love, / Cheer and animate my heart.
Though pressed, we will not yield, / But shall prevail at length, / For Jesus is our sun and shield, / Our righteousness and strength.
Hungry, and faint, and poor, / Behold us, LORD, again / Assembled at thy mercies door, / Thy bounty to obtain.
Now may He who from the dead / Brought the Shepherd of the sheep, / JESUS CHRIST, our King and Head, / All our souls in safety keep!
